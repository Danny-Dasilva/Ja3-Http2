## Lists
[osx-nix-ja3.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salesforce/ja3/master/lists/osx-nix-ja3.csv) is a list of JA3 hashes to application name(s) for OSX and Linux.

This list was generated using an automated process with some manual checking. As applications can vary per environment, please use this list as a best-guess and as an example of JA3's capabilities. Any assistance in fine tuning is appreciated. For example, some of the "Used by many programs" JA3s can likely be linked to specific APIs.

We're working on a Windows list and getting the automation working there. If you would like to contribute, please make a pull request or contact [John Althouse](mailto:jalthouse@salesforce.com).
